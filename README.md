# gamepad-battery-splash
Displays a little splash-screen overlay on the top of the screen when a wireless gamepad reaches low battery levels.

## Current Limitations

I would like to work on these in the future. However, I don't have much time currently.

* Splash overlay does not show gamepad ID (player number)
* There are no options regarding the splash overlay
* Only displays correctly on top of apps that do *not* run in exclusive full-screen mode
* No multi-monitor support
* No option for notifications (toast noficiations, sounds, etc.)
* Only works on Windows
